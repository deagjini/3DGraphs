# 3DGraphs
A program that uses matplotlib.pyplot, and tkinter on the Spyder IDE to offer a visual interpretation of the various graphs I work with in MATH 119 (multi variable calculus).

This program uses a tkinter prompt to ask the user which graph they would like to display (either a surface plot or contour plot), and generates a random color for the graph and displays it in another window in which the user can rotate the graph and see it from various angles. 
My decision to include a color randomiser came from the fact that I found all the colors and pattern to be very visually appealing and could not choose between one, and thus I let my program decide for me. 
I decided to create this program when I encountered a problem in my course homework which asked instructed me to choose my favorite graphing tool to visualize the the 3D graph of f(x,y). Upon a quick search on the internet I realized I did not like any of the graphing tools available online. Henceforth, I created my own favorite graphing tool using the matplotlib.pyplot concepts I learned in first semester, as well as guidance from the internet.
It has proven to be a very useful tool for my course!
